    "\n",
    "A function is an independent block of code that only runs when you call it to like print(). You can call it and reuse the code as many times as you want to with different parameters. This notebook will show you some basic functions, so feel free to add extra elements you've learned throughout this course to make them more complex.\n",

    "## How to write your own function\n",
    "To start writing a function - you must declare it using **def** followed by the name you want to call the function with.\n",
    "After the name, a function will always have brackets; if they are empty, there are no parameters to be called with the function."
